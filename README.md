# Celebal_technologies_Assignment-1
This repository contains solutions to a set of Python programming tasks designed to practice concepts such as conditional statements (if-else), arithmetic operations, string compression, combinatorics with iterators, tuple usage, and string formatting. Each task is implemented in a separate Python script with clear explanations and examples.

### Task-
py-if-else task: Uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to make decisions based on input values. python-arithmetic-operators: Involves performing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. compress-the-string: Compresses a string by counting consecutive characters, often using itertools.groupby(). the-minion-game: A string game where players earn points by forming substrings starting with vowels or consonants. write-a-function: Teaches how to define reusable blocks of code using the def keyword. word-order: Counts and displays the number of occurrences of each word while preserving their input order. iterables-and-iterators: Works with iterators and combinations to solve problems involving sequences and probabilities. python-tuples: Introduces immutable sequences and their use in operations like hashing. finding-the-percentage: Calculates and formats the average marks of a student from a given dataset. python-string-formatting: Demonstrates ways to format and align strings and numbers for clean output.
