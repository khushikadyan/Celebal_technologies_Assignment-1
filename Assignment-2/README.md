| `collections-counter.py`         | Collections Counter        | Uses Python's `collections.Counter` to calculate total earnings.            |
| `exceptions.py`                  | Exception Handling         | Handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` during integer division.       |
| `incorrect-regex.py`             | Incorrect Regex            | Checks if a string is a valid regular expression using `re.compile()`.      |
| `set-discard-remove-pop.py`   | Set Methods Task           | Demonstrates use of `discard()`, `remove()`, and `pop()` on Python sets.    |

##  How to Run

Each task is implemented in its own Python file. You can run them individually using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## Screenshots
A folder named /screenshots has been included in the project directory. It contains visual proof of execution for each Python script.

Each screenshot shows the terminal output after running the corresponding script.

This helps in validating functionality and understanding expected input/output.

To view the results, navigate to the /screenshots folder and open the image files.
